# PhilipVoiceAI

Do you want to be updated with the news worldwide 🤓?, would you like to know which clubs or athletes are already champions on these dates 💪🏾?, or perhaps, which stocks of the largest companies are going up or down ⬆️⬇️?, among many other things more 💫💫💫.

Today I bring you a project in which I used artificial intelligence 🤖 to make requests to a news API (Application Programming Interface) 🗞️ via voice command 🎙️.

The technologies used in this APP were Reactjs 💙, Tailwindcss 💙 and Alan AI 🤍💙. I left you the link of the application 👇🏾👇🏾👇🏾:

Also, I made a short video 📽️ with everything you can ask the APP 😮 and I attached the documentation so that you can experiment with these new technologies 🫡 which in particular I think are extremely necessary. 
Without more to say, enjoy the video 🥳🥳🥳!!
